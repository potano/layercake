Layercake is a manager for Gentoo binary-package build hosts.

Gentoo's https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide[Binary package guide] describes
how to set up a host for building binary packages to be deployed on one or more target
systems.  This allows the administrator to build once and deploy multiple times.  An added
benefit is that the target machines remain fully usable during the build process.

A major limitation of the methods presented in the Binary-package guide is that the target
machines must have the same CHOST, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and USE-flag settings as the host
which builds the packages.  If the processors on the various machines are of different
generations, the processor-specific USE flags must follow the lowest common denominator.

Gentoo users are already familiar with using a _chroot_ in the process of setting up a
Gentoo Linux system.  This ensures that the setup is done cleanly from the initial stage
tarball.  In the same way, using a _chroot_ on the binary package host lets the user
target a configuration which varies significantly from that of the host
system.  It also opens the possibility of having multiple build roots on the same build
host, each with its own target configuration.

Layercake makes this easy to manage:

- Target systems may be configured differently than the build host.

- Host systems need not use Gentoo Linux; most other Linux distributions should work.

- A build host may contain multiple build roots, each with its own USE-flag and other
settings.

- A single system-wide Portage tree (plus overlays) may be shared among all build roots;
no need to sync individual trees.

- Supports similar system-wide sharing of other directories such as downloaded tarballs
(_distfiles_ directory)

- Maintains symlinks needed for a web server to access binary-package directories.  Also
maintains such symlinks for any supplemental-file directories the user may configure.

- Automatically performs any needed mounts, including `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, and
shared directories as configured.  Each build root has its own mount configuration.

- Places each build root with its associated files and directories into its own containing
directory.

- Includes a separate executable, _stagemaker_, that generates customized stage tarballs
for setting up new target machines.  Such tarballs, when stored in the supplemental-file
directories mentioned above, become available for download from the build server.

- Sets the `PS1` environment variable at chroot time to indicate not only that a chroot is
active but also the name of the build root.

- Allows multiple simultaneous chroot sessions on a build root.  Layercake does mount
operations only when needed and checks that any existing mounts have the correct endpoints.
(It is still up to the user to ensure that no more than one _emerge_ operation is in
progress at a time.)

Layercake has a major feature which can result in substantial savings in build time and disk
space.  In cases where two or more target systems have mostly the same USE-flag configuration
and similar architectures, generally only a few packages will have actual USE-flag settings
which differ between targets.  That means that from one build root to another most packages
turn out to have the same configuration.  By means of OverlayFS mounts, Layercake can mount
a build root on top of another.  When the user builds or updates packages in the lower
build root, the installed packages are visible in the upper build root--and a world update
in the upper layer would have to build only those packages with different USE flags.  This
makes it so that there is much less work to do in the upper build root--and a reduced
space requirement in the build host.

This support for overlay mounts of one build root on top of another gives rise to the name
_Layercake_.  The _layers_ of this layercake are the build roots plus their associated data.
At least one layer must be a _base layer_, meaning that it is built up from a stage file in a
process that is largely the same as described in the Gentoo Handbook.  One or more
_derived layers_ may be layered on top of a base layer or even another derived layer.
Layercake places no limit on the height of such a stack of derived layers.  Since kernel
version 4.0 or so, neither does OverlayFS.

A _layer directory_ is a directory that holds all the filesystem entries for a layer: the
build root, a configuration file, the OverlayFS directories for the build root, and so on.
A layer's name is the name of its layer directory.

[NOTE]
Overlay mounts work only if the Overlay Filesystem (`CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS`) is enabled in the
running kernel.

[NOTE]
Layercake currently has no support for cross compilation.  All build-time dependencies
must be able to execute natively on the host machine.  This means that the CHOST and
_-march_ settings in all layers must be compatable with the host hardware.

Layercake and Stagemaker are written in the Go language and have no dependencies beyond the
Go standard library.  They build to statically linked executables that include defaults that
permit operation without configuration files.  link:doc/installation.adoc[Installation from
source] is almost trivially easy.


== Basic Usage Patterns

These steps assume the user has configured and initialized the Layercake installation in
an operational Gentoo host environment.  Many configurations are possible.  For details
about the setup, see link:doc/layercake_setup.adoc[Setting up the Layercake environment].

These examples assume further that the build host has the name "builder" and that we have set
up a web server that listens on port 1000 to serve documents from the Layercake exports
directory.


=== Create, populate, and use a base layer

We use the term _base layer_ to denote a layer built up fully from a stage tarball according
to instructions in the Gentoo Handbook.

In this example we use "rosebud" as the name of the layer and intend to build the layer with
a USE-flag setup to match an already-deployed target.  Start with this command:

--------------------
layercake add rosebud
--------------------

This generates the layer along with its build-root directory and `layerconfig` file.  Note
the basic calling form of Layercake:  the first positional paramter is the name of a command;
additional positional parameters are arguments.

Whereas the Handbook has you create, mount, and chdir to a new root filesystem, use this
command instead:

--------------------
layercake shell rosebud
--------------------

This opens a shell in the build root directory.  Here is where you select, download, and
install a stage tarball and set things up in in preparation for the chroot.  You can save
time by copying Portage files from your existing target.  Don't forget to copy
`/etc/resolv.conf` from the host system.

In most cases, there is no need to edit the link:doc/layercake_layerconfig.adoc[layer's
configuration file].  If there is, it is easily reached at this point because it is in the
parent directory of the build root.

When setting up _make.conf_, be sure to add the _buildpkg_ and _binpkg-multi-instance_
features to the FEATURES variable.  (You may omit _binpkg-multi-instance_ if you will
never use OverlayFS mounts.)

Once the build root is set up with the basic configuration, exit the current shell and
enter the chroot with this command:

--------------------
layercake chroot rosebud
--------------------

If you get a message about a mountpoint directory not existing, fix the problem and try the
_layercake chroot_ again.

Of note:  for these examples, we assume we are using the host system's Portage tree and
overlays at the directory `/var/db/repos`.  Since this is the default configuration and
the _layercake chroot_ command makes the mounts automatically, there is no need to download
the initial Portage tree or to do _emerge sync_ within the chroot.

As to steps the Gentoo Handbook gives at this point

- Skip mounting the boot partition
- Skip _emerge-webrsync_ and _emerge --sync_ unless running on a non-Gentoo build host
- Select the desired profile, which might well be a custom profile
- Set up the USE variables
- Set up the time zone if desired
- Set up the locale
- Skip setting up the kernel and initramfs but emerge firmware if the targets will need it
- Skip setup steps for network, fstab, root password, and bootloader

The layer is fully accessible from other Bash prompts.  There is no problem at all
for a user to issue a _layercake chroot_ command to have an additional chroot into the
layer or to issue _layercake shell_ to switch to the layer's build root while still keeping
access to the full host filesystem.  The latter can be quite helpful if your editor of choice
is not _nano_.

Build all the packages your target will need.  Once done, you may exit the chroot.  Note
that this action never unmounts anything.  To unmount a layer (short of rebooting or
unmounting by hand!) issue the _layercake umount_ command:

--------------------
layercake umount rosebud
--------------------

Note that it is rarely necessary to unmount a layer.

==== On the target host

Assuming that we have set up the layer with USE flags and _march_ to match an existing target
system and then built a full set of packages for it, we can set up the target to use the
build root by setting the following entries in the target's make.conf:

- FEATURES="getbinpkg"
- PORTAGE_BINHOST="http://builder:1000/packages/rosebud"

Now an _emerge world_ should pick up all its new packages from the build host.

=== Create and use a child (derived) layer

This is much simpler than setting up a base layer.  Here we assume the derived layer,
called "notebook", has a different set of processor flags than does rosebud.

--------------------
layercake add notebook rosebud
--------------------

This form of the _add_ command specifies the base layer ("rosebud") for the new layer
("notebook").  Since this is not a base layer, we can go directly to the chroot:

--------------------
layercake chroot notebook
--------------------

Edit the Portage configuration as necessary and build according to the new configuration
with the confidence that the base layer remains unaltered.

This time we need to set up a new machine.  We could start with a recent stage3 file on
that machine, but we would likely be faced with rebuilding packages on that machine
since some of the packages in the @system set would now have different USE flags.  We
avoid this problem by using _stagemaker_ to generate a stage3 tarball that matches the
build environment.

Since we write the new stage tarball to a directory outside the build root (and also because
_stagemaker_ itself is not part of the build root), we cannot stay in the chroot to generate
the stage.  Exit the chroot and issue these commands to generate the stage tarball:

--------------------
layercake shell notebook
mkdir ../generated
layercake mount notebook
stagemaker -generate -o ../generated/stage.tar.gz
--------------------

The _layercake shell_ command takes us to the build directory, the _mkdir_ command creates
the directory to hold the stage file, the _layercake mount_ command ensures the needed
symlink is visible to the web server, and the _stagemaker_ command generates the actual stage
tarball.

Note that while Stagemaker is designed to operate with an arbitrary root directory and has no
requirement to be confined to a chroot, nothing keeps it from working in a chroot with
the *-root /* option.  It is a static executable with no configuration file needed.

==== On the target host

Now as we set up the new target, we download the stage tarball with

--------------------
wget http://builder:1000/generated/notebook/stage.tar.gz
tar xzpf stage.tar.gz --xattrs-include='*.*'
--------------------

or, if you are more adventurous,

--------------------
curl http://builder:1000/generated/notebook/stage.tar.gz | tar xzp --xattrs-include='*.*'
--------------------

The *--xattrs-include* switch is still required for Stagemaker-generated tarballs in order to
extract file capabilities, but *--numeric-owner* is not because Stagemaker does not store
user or group names.

Stage tarballs that come from the Gentoo upstream contain vanilla copies of all files in
`/bin`, `/etc`, `/usr`, and `/var` as generated from the ebuilds in the system set plus
vanilla `/etc/portage` settings.  By contrast, the stagemaker utility copies over any edits
made to these files in the build root.  This is a handy way to propate settings you will use
all the time, but there are caveats as regards the Portage files `/etc/portage/make.conf` and
`/var/lib/portage/world`.

In make.conf on the target machine, be sure to remove _buildpkg_ and _binpkg-multi-instance_
from the FEATURES variable and add _getbinpkg_. Add a PORTAGE_BINHOST variable to point to
your build host.

- FEATURES="getbinpkg"
- PORTAGE_BINHOST="http://builder:1000/packages/rosebud"

The world file in the generated stage tarball includes the full set of entries in the
build root's `/var/lib/portage/world`.  Since you may want only a subset of these packages on
the target machine, so be sure to edit out any such lines before emerging world.  Edit as
needed and then do the world update.

Now you may finish the setup as the Gentoo Handbook instructs.

- The _stagemaker_ utility lets you customize the stage tarball in helpful ways.  You can add
files such as helper scripts for setting up the bootloader or rsyncing the Portage tree from
the build host.  You can also add packages from the build root that are beyond the @system
set, such as _eix_, _gentoolkit_, and your favorite text editor--with proper dependency
resolution.  See the link:doc/stagemaker_manpage.adoc[Stagemaker documentation] for details.
