== Layercake installation

There are three ways to install Layercake:

* <<ebuild,Add the ebuild to a local overlay>> and install with Portage.
This is the preferred method for Gentoo build hosts.
* <<from_source,Install from source>>.
* Build on another host using one of the above methods and <<copy_binaries,copy the binaries
to the target machine>>.


[[ebuild]]
=== Add ebuild and install with Portage

At present the only option for adding the ebuild is to insert it into a custom ebuild
repository (also referred to as a "local overlay").
The https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Parts/Portage/CustomTree#Defining_a_custom_ebuild_repository[Handbook]
describes now to do the needed setup.

The instructions here assume that the custom repo is called "localrepo" in keeping with the
example given in the Handbook.
We also assume a base directory for the ebuild repositories of `/var/db/repos` and a package
category of "dev-util".
Create the package directory and switch to it:

----
mkdir -p /var/db/repos/localrepo/dev-util/layercake
cd /var/db/repos/localrepo/dev-util/layercake
----

Place the ebuild into the directory and update the manifest.
Here we assume the release is 2.0.0_beta3.

----
wget https://github.com/potano/layercake/releases/download/2.0.0_beta3/layercake-2.0.0_beta3.ebuild
ebuild layercake-2.0.0_beta3.ebuild manifest
----

Now the package is visible to Portage and may be emerged normally.
For subsequent pre-release versions, simply repeat the steps of downloading the new ebuild
and updating the manifest.

[NOTE]
The beta ebuilds of Layercake are not masked or keyworded.
This reduces the friction of using and testing the package for anyone who already went to the
trouble of installing the ebuild by hand.

[NOTE]
The distribution tarball contains all the man and info pages.  Applying the _doc_ USE flag
forces a rebuild of these using the needed toolchain pulled in as dependencies.


[[from_source]]
=== Installation from source

There are several ways to do this depending on the software available on the host machine and
the needs of the user.
All assume that version 14 or later of Go compiler is installed.
Non-privileged users may perform all these steps except for installing to privileged
directories.

==== Building from a distribution tarball

Inside a suitable working directory download and untar the distribution tarball and switch to
the layercake base directory.
This illustration assumes the version is 2.0.0_beta3:

----
wget https://github.com/potano/layercake/releases/download/2.0.0_beta3/layercake-2.0.0_beta3.tar.gz
cd layercake-2.0.0_beta3
----

From this point the method depends on whether the user is the root user and if _make_ is
available on the host machine.

* The easiest method is available when _make_ is installed and the user is _root_: +
+
----
make install
----
+
This builds the binaries, installs them to `/usr/bin/` and installs the man and info pages.

* The default _make_ target is suitable for non-privileged users +
+
----
make
----
+
This leaves the `layercake` and `stagemaker` binaries in the `bin/` directory and the
prebuilt documentation files `layercake.1`, `stagemaker.1`, and `layercake.info` in the
`doc/` directory. The user may then copy them to where they are needed.

[[no_make]]
* When _make_ is not available, run these commands: +
+
--------------
go build -o bin/layercake cmd/layercake/...
go build -o bin/stagemaker cmd/stagemaker/...
--------------
+
Again, the user may hand-install the binaries and the documentation from the mentioned
locations.


==== Building from the Git repo

This alternative approach requires more setup if the user wants the man pages and info
file.  This requires the following packages to be installed beyond Go and Git:

* https://asciidoc.org[asciidoc] (not asciidoctor)
* http://docbook2x.sourceforge.net[docbook2X] (note: the link uses http:, not https:)
* https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo[texinfo]

--------------
git clone http://github.com/potano/layercake
cd layercake
make install
--------------

The user may use the `install-bin` target instead if the documentation toolchain is not
available.  Follow the <<no_make,make-not-available>> instructions above if needed.


[[copy_binaries]]
=== Copy binaries to the target host

The `layercake` and `stagemaker` binaries generated on one Linux machine should run without
difficulty on any other Linux machine with the same architecture (but not recommended on
kernels older than 4.0).

These are the files of interest as created by the build process and/or as present in the
distribution tarball.  Paths are relative to the base of the layercake repo.

`bin/layercake`, `bin/stagemaker`::
Layercake and Stagemaker binaries.

`doc/layercake.1`, `doc/stagemaker.1`::
Man pages for Layercake and Stagemaker.

`doc/layercake.info`::
Info file for Layercake.

This command makes a tarball that can be transferred to the target machine:

----
tar czf layercake.tar.gz --xlate='s/^\./layercake/' bin/* doc/*.{1,info}
----

After transferring the tarball to the target machine, the root user may extract the files
and install them to their proper locations.

----
export PREFIX=
tar xzf layercake.tar.gz
chown -R root:root layercake
mv layercake/bin/{layercake,stagemaker} $PREFIX/usr/local/bin
mv layercake/doc/*.1 $PREFIX/usr/share/man/man1
mv layercake/doc/*.info $PREFIX/usr/share/info
----

[NOTE]
Set `$PREFIX` if needed for a prefix installation.

Cross-compilation to a target with a differing architecture may work, but has not been
tested.
To try this, prefix the _make_ or _go_ commands shown in the build-from-source section
with the appropriate environment variables set.  For example,

----
GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 make
----

After this, transfer and install the files as described above.
