Installation from source
========================

This procedure assumes that version 14 or later of Go compiler is installed.  A
non-privileged user may perform all these steps except for copying the executables to
public directories.

- Inside a suitable working directory, clone the Git repository

--------------
git clone http://github.com/potano/layercake
--------------

- Switch to the `layercake` directory

--------------
cd layercake
--------------

- Build the Layercake and Stagemaker binaries

--------------
make
--------------

If _make_ is not available, run these two commands instead

--------------
go build -o bin/layercake cmd/layercake/...
go build -o bin/stagemaker cmd/stagemaker/...
--------------

By either approach both executable files are written to the `layercake/bin/` directory.

- Copy the binaries to where they may be needed

The root user might install them with these two commands:

--------------
mv ~normaluser/path/layercake/bin/{layercake,stagemaker} /usr/share/bin
chown root:root /usr/share/bin/{layercake,stagemaker}
--------------
