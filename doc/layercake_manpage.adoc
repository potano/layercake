NAME
----
layercake - manager of Gentoo binary-build-roots


SYNOPSIS
--------
*layercake* ['main-options'] 'command' ['command-options']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Layercake allows an administrator to deploy and manage one or more Gentoo build roots on a
build-host machine.


MAIN OPTIONS
------------
Note that these and all other switches may begin with either one or two hyphens.

*-config* `filename`::
Select a main configuration file.  This switch takes precedence over the `LAYERCONF`
environment variable.

*-basepath* `path`
Select a Layercake base directory.  This overrides both the `LAYERROOT` environment variable
and and the base-path setting in the configuration file(s).


COMMANDS
--------

*init*::
Set up the Layercake base directory at the base path specified by the first of the following
that is present:
- *-basepath* switch
- `LAYERROOT` environment variable
- configuration-file setting
- default path: `/var/lib/layercake`

*status* [`layername`]::
Displays the status of a layer or of the installation as a whole.  The display of a layer's
status includes an indication of the layer's state:
defined but empty::: layer added but has an empty build-root directory
incomplete setup::: layer directory and configuration file exist but the build-root and/or
needed _overlayfs_ directories are missing
not yet populated::: some layer setup is done but at least one of the needed needed FHS
directories in the build root are missing (`bin`,  `etc`, `lib`, `opt`, `root`, `sbin`,
or `usr`)
build directories set up::: FHS directories are in place but at least one configured
mountpoint directory is missing
mountable::: all needed directories are in place; the layer is mountable
partially mounted::: all needed directories are in place but at least one configured
mountpoint is not mounted
mounted and ready::: layer is ready for use and is ready to be chrooted
mounted; cannot be unmounted::: layer is ready for use and can be chrooted, but cannot
be unmounted because the working directories are in use

*list* [-v]::
Displays a list of layers under the Layercake base directory, one line per layer.  The
listing shows the layer name, the text "(base level)" if a base level or the name of the
parent layer if a derived layer, an indication of whether the layer is in use, and the
layer's status as shown for the _layercake status_ command, above. +
Adding the _-v_ switch lists mount details and any error messages for each layer.

*add* 'layername' ['base-layer']::
Adds a new layer named 'layername'.  The resulting layer directory will contain a
configuration file and a build-root directory.  The one-argument form ('layername' only)
results in a base layer; the two-argument form (with 'base-layer' specified) results in a
layer derived from the specified layer (which may itself be a derived layer).  When adding
a derived layer, the _layercake add_ command also adds two helper directories to the
layer directory in support of _overlayfs_ mounts. +
 +
The prototype for the new layer's +layerconfig+ file depends on the type of layer.  Base
layers receive a configuration from the +default_layerconfig.skel+ file in the Layercake
base directory; derived layers' configuration comes from the configuration of 'base-layer'.
In either case the user is free to edit the configuration file before proceeding with further
steps.

*shell* 'layername'::
Opens a subshell in the build-root directory.  The result is *not* a chroot; the user retains
full access to the host filesystem and its commands.  The parent directory of the build root
is the layer directory.  This gives the user easy access to the layer's `layerconfig` file
and generated-files directory.  Since `$PWD` points to the build directory, the layer
shows up as being in use in the _layercake status_ and _layercake list_ commands.  Upon
exiting the shell, the user has quick access to the command history, making it easy to edit
the command to mount or chroot to the layer.

*mount* 'layername'::
Mounts the layer:  performs mount operations on the layer for any configured mountpoints that
are not yet mounted.  Also generates any symlinks from the export directories to the
configured target directories.  Some symlink operations need no explicit configuration:  if
the layer directory contains a +packages+ or +generated+ directory, the command makes
symlinks to these.  Before mounting a derived layer, the command performs the same mount
operation from the layer's ultimate base layer through the chain of derivation.  Naturally,
the command fails if any of the layers in the chain are not ready for mounting. +
 +
In order to facilitate the unmounting of pseudo filesystems on hosts which use an init system
that keeps a persistent hold on the the _cgroup_ mechanism, Layercake automatically applies
the recursive *MS_SLAVE* propagation setting to those mounts (`/dev`, `/proc`, `/run`, and
`/sys`).

*chroot* 'layername'::
Chroots into the layer's build root.  The layer must be mountable:  the command runs an
implicit _layercake mount_ command as part of the operation.  Exiting the chroot leaves the
layer in a mounted state.

*shake*::
Remounts all mounted derived layers to ensure that changes in lower layers propagate to
mounted child layers.

*umount* 'layername'::
Unmount the specified layer if it is mounted and idle.  Any layers derived from the layer
must be unmounted.

*umount -all*::
Unmount all layers that are mounted but idle.

*unmount* 'layername' | *-all*::
Synonym for *umount*.

*mkdirs* ['layername']::
Regenerates missing build-root and _overlayfs_ directories in the layer.

*rename* 'oldname' 'newname'::
Renames a layer from `oldname` to `newname`.  Also patches the configurations of any derived
layers to reflect the new parent-layer name.  The layer must be unmounted and not in use, as
must be any layers which ultimately depend on the layer being renamed.

*rebase* 'layername' ['new-base-layer']::
Changes a layer's base layer.  Changes the layer to a base layer if the 'new-base-layer'
argument is omitted.  The layer and any derived layers must be unmounted and not in use.
The command is its most useful when settting layers before their first use; applying the
command to layers which have had build activity requires great care.  Use at your own risk
in these situations.

*remove* 'layername' [-files]::
Removes a layer.  Layer must be unmounted, not in use, and have no derived layers.  Removes
the layer directory completely only if the build root is still empty, otherwise the command
renames the directory to append _~removed_ to the layer name.  Since the directory now has
a name that is not a legal layer name, it does not show up in the _layercake list_ command
output.

Normal Unix file and syscall permissions apply:  a normal user with write permisions on a
Layercake base-directory tree may run any of these commands except *mount*, *umount*, and
*chroot*.  With the base directory located elsewhere, normal users are restricted to the
*status*, *list*, and *shell* commands.


GLOBAL OPTIONS
--------------
These may be specified at any position among the Layercake command-line arguments.

[horizontal]
*-v*:: Verbose mode: show actions to be taken
*-p*:: Pretend to carry out actions
*-force*:: Force action
*-debug*:: Show debugging output


LAYERCAKE BASE DIRECTORY
------------------------
Layercake directs its operations to a base directory.  Within this directory is a directory
to contain the individual layer directories and another to act as the document directory for
a web or file server.  All these names are configurable.  Layercake works well with the
built-in defaults, as shown here.

`/var/lib/layercake`::
Base directory.  The user is free to add other entries here beyond the following.
`layers`:::
Home directory of the layer directories.  A layer directory has a legal layer name (letters,
digits, underscores, and hyphens but not beginning with a hyphen) and contains a
`layerconfig` file.  A deactivated layer directory is like a layer directory but has a name
that is not a legal layer name.  The layers directory should contain no other entries.
`export`:::
Home directory of export symlinks.  Directory is designed to be able to act as the document
root of files for export via a web or file server.  Layercake uses the names `packages` and
`generated` within this directory; the user is free to add other entries as needed.
`default_layerconfig.skel`:::
Layer-configuration file that provides the default skeleton for the `layerconfig` files to
write into base layers via the _layercake add_ command.


LAYER DIRECTORY
---------------
All the directories and files needed for the operation of a layer are placed into a single
directory.  The directory names shown here are defaults.

`layerconfig`::
Layer-configuration file.  Specifies the mounts the layer needs, any explicit symlinks, and,
if the layer is a derived layer, the name of the one from which it derives.  Required.  See
below for format.

`build/`::
Build root.  Center of the action.  The _layercake shell_ and _layercake chroot_ commands
come here.  Is the mountpoint for _overlayfs_ mounts of derived layers and the lower
directory of _overlayfs_ mounts when the layer serves as the basis of another layer.
Subdirectories of this directory may serve as mountpoints.

`overlay/`::
Directory to hold the two working _overlayfs_ directories.  Is present only in derived
layers.

`upperdir/`:::
_Overlayfs_ upper directory.

`workdir/`:::
_Overlayfs_ work directory.

`packages/`::
Source directory of a bind mount onto the `/var/cache/binpkgs` directory in the build root,
typically only in a base layer for sharing among all layers derived from the base layer.
Generated automatically at mount time if `layerconfig` specifies it as an export.

`generated/`::
Directory of user-generated files for export via the web or file server.  The mount operation
automatically makes a symlink in `export/generated` if this directory is present.  The user
must create this directory if needed.

The layer directory may contain other entries as they user may deploy.


EXPORT DIRECTORY
----------------
Directory containing entries for export via a web or file server.

`packages/`::
Directory of symlinks to binary-package directories of layers.  Entries in this directory
are symlinks named for the layers to which they pertain.  The link sources, configured by
the layer, are typically the directories `packages` or `build/var/cache/binpkgs` relative
to the layer directory.

`generated/`::
Directory of symlinks to generated-files directories of layers.  Entries in this directory
are symlinks named for the layers to which they pertain with sources as the `generated`
directory within the layer directory.

`index.html`::
Dummy HTTPd index file which the user may change or remove to suit.


CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------
The configuration file is a text file with one key/value pair per line.  Configuration files
may be chained.  In such cases, values set earlier in the chain take precendence over values
that come later.  The file may contain blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning
with `#` or `//`.

Layercake looks for the first configuration file found in this order:

- Name given via the *-config* command-line switch
- Name given by the `$LAYERCONF` environment variable
- `$HOME/.layercake`
- `etc/layercake.conf` where the `etc` directory is in the parent of the directory holding
the Layercake executable.  Thus if the executable is named `/usr/bin/layercake`, Layercake
looks for `/usr/etc/layercake.conf`.

//-
BASEPATH::
Base-path directory.  Root directory of all Layercake operations.  Default:
`/var/lib/layercake`

LAYERS::
Name of directory that contains all the layer directories.  The default of `layers` is
relative to BASEPATH.

BUILDROOT::
Name of build-root directory within a layer directory.  Default `build`.  Must not be an
absolute path.

BINPKGS::
Name of binary-packages directory for the layer.  Default `packages`.  Must not be an
absolute path.  Note that Layercake expects the directory to exist only if a layer's
configuration calls for it.

GENERATED_FILES::
Name of the directory within the layer directory for generated files for export.  Default
`generated`.

WORKDIR::
Name of the _overlayfs_ work directory for the layer.  Default `overlayfs/workdir`.

UPPERDIR::
Name of the _overlayfs_ upper directory for the layer.  Default `overlayfs/upperdir`.

EXPORTS::
Name of the directory of symlinks under the base layer.  Default `export`.

EXPORT_BINPKGS::
Name of the directory of export symlinks under the EXPORTS directory.  Default `packages`.

EXPORT_GENERATED_FILES::
Name of the directory of generated-file symlinks under the EXPORTS directory.  Default
`generated`.

CHROOT_EXEC::
Pathname to the _chroot_ executable.

CONFIGFILE::
Pathname of the next configuration file to load.


LAYER-CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------------
Every layer must contain a `layerconfig` file to indicate from which layer it derives
(if any), the mounts that must be made to directories within the chroot ("imports") and
any explicit symlinks to generate for export to the EXPORTS directory ("exports").
Non-blank, non-comment lines must have the form _declaration <arguments>_.

*base* 'layername'::
Indicates the layer is a derived layer, where 'layername' is the name of the lower layer of
the _overlayfs_ mount.  Base layers do not have such a declaration.

*import* 'mount-type' 'source' 'mountpoint'::
Indicates a mount from the host filesystem into the build root.  The 'mountpoint' path is
always relative to the build root and 'mount-type' is a *mount*(2) mount type such as
'bind', 'rbind', or 'proc'.  The 'source' argument may be an absolute host-system path such
as '/dev' or '/sys' or may have a special prefix to indicate a path relative to a layer
directory:
[horizontal]
`$$self`::: Relative to the current layer directory
`$$base`::: Relative to the base layer's directory +
The latter form is especially useful mounting the layer's binary-package directory (typically
`/var/cache/binpkgs` to the common `packages` directory for all layers sharing a common base.

*export* 'mount-type' 'source' 'target'::
Indicates the creation of a symlink from a file or directory in the build root to a export
directory so that the web or file server may have access to the needed item.  The arguments
maintain a similarity to the arguments of the *import* directive:  the 'mount-type' indicates
the linkage type, which for exports must always be `symlink`, and the 'source' argument is
a path relative to the build root.  The 'target' must be one of the following:
[horizontal]
`$$package_export`::: Makes an entry under `export/packages`
`$file_export`::: Makes an entry under `export/generated`


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
`HOME`::
User's home directory: used to search for a configuration file `$HOME/.layercake`.
Layercake uses this as the configuration in preference to both `$LAYERCONF` and
`etc/layercake.conf`.

`LAYERCONF`::
Pathname of layer configuration file to use in preference to `etc/layercake.conf`

`LAYERROOT`::
Layercake base directory to use in preference to one set in any configuration file.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
[horizontal]
*0*:: Success
*1*:: Failure
