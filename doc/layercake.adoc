== Introduction

Layercake is a manager for Gentoo binary-package build hosts.
It retains the usual advantages of build hosts--build once/install many; minimized downtime
when installing updates--while easing the set-up burdens.
Among its features:

- Allows multiple build roots on a build host, each with its own USE-flag and other settings.

- Target systems may be configured differently than the build host.

- Host systems need not use Gentoo Linux; most other Linux distributions should work.
The executable is statically linked and thus independent of the C library in use.

- A single system-wide Portage tree (plus overlays) may be shared among all build roots;
no need to sync individual trees.

- Supports similar system-wide sharing of other directories such as downloaded tarballs
(_distfiles_ directory)

- Maintains symlinks needed for a web server to access binary-package directories.  Also
maintains such symlinks for any supplemental-file directories the user may configure.

- Automatically performs any needed mounts, including `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, and
shared directories as configured.  Each build root has its own mount configuration.

- Places each build root with its associated files and directories into its own containing
directory.

- Is packaged with a separate executable, _stagemaker_, that generates customized stage
tarballs for setting up new target machines.
Such tarballs, when stored in the supplemental-file directories mentioned above, become
available for download from the build server.
(_stagemaker_ is also statically linked.)

- Sets the `PS1` environment variable at chroot time to indicate not only that a chroot is
active but also the name of the build root.

- Allows multiple simultaneous chroot sessions on a build root.  Layercake does mount
operations only when needed and checks that any existing mounts have the correct endpoints.
(It is still up to the user to ensure that no more than one _emerge_ operation is in
progress at a time.)

- Allows the user to set up build roots on OverlayFS mounts on other build roots.  When the
build roots in question have similar configurations, this generally results in very
substantial savings in build time and disk space:  packages that have the same configuration
between such a pair of build roots need to be built only once when a new version comes out.

- Easy to hand-install if necessary.
